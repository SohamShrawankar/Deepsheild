# 🛡️ DeepShield – Cloaking AI-Proof Images

**DeepShield** is an advanced AI privacy toolkit designed to protect personal images (like profile pictures) from being harvested and misused by AI models for facial recognition, deepfake training, or dataset creation. By embedding **invisible adversarial perturbations**, DeepShield confuses AI systems while keeping images perfectly normal to human eyes.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **AI Cloaking**: Subtle pixel-level perturbations confuse neural networks without altering image quality for humans.
- 🧠 **AI Detection**: Check if an image is already protected (cloaked) or not.
- 🌫️ **Invisible Shield View**: Visualize the hidden adversarial mask that acts as a shield.
- 🖼️ **Watermarking**: Secure watermarking using hash-based image stamping.
- 🪞 **Real-time Preview**: Tkinter-based GUI preview support.

## 📸 How It Works

> “Invisible to the human eye, disruptive to AI.”

- A custom GAN-like generator creates subtle changes in image pixels.
- These changes don't affect human perception but scramble AI training algorithms.
- The model leverages adversarial training principles using `TensorFlow`, `OpenCV`, and `NumPy`.

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/DeepShield.git
cd DeepShield
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🧪 Example Usage

```python
from cloaking_utils import cloak_image, detect_cloaking

# Cloak the image
cloaked_img = cloak_image("profile.jpg")

# Save cloaked image
cloaked_img.save("protected_profile.jpg")

# Detect if an image is cloaked
is_cloaked = detect_cloaking("some_image.jpg")
print("Cloaked:", is_cloaked)
```

## 🔒 Why This Matters

With the rapid advancement in generative AI, unauthorized use of images for training deepfake or surveillance models has become a serious concern. **DeepShield** empowers users to **regain control over their digital identity**.
